## House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project focuses on applying Simple and Multiple Linear Regression techniques to predict house prices based on several housing features. The dataset includes variables like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and furnishing status.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Pandas for data handling
3. Scikit-learn for model building and performance evaluation
4. Matplotlib for plotting and data visualization

ðŸ“‚ Project Steps
1.Data Preparation:
Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Ensured all input features are numeric and clean.

2.Model Development:
Divided data into training and test sets.
Built a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.

3.Model Testing:
Assessed model accuracy with:

    1.Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    2.Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    3.R-squared (RÂ²)

4.Results Interpretation:
Displayed feature coefficients to understand influence on price.
Plotted prediction vs actual values for analysis.
